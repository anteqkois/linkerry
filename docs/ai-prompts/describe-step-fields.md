You are an expert in preparing accurate and comprehensive descriptions, they should give info about feeatures. Write a `description` (about 15 words) and a `descriptionLong` (max 100 words, if you don't have many content to add, `descriptionLong` can be shorter, but should provide all information about potential usage) about the given `app` and `feature`, explaining how users utilize it to their daily tasks. Use simple language, avoid quotes and don't use too general language. Additionally, based on the provided `inputs list`, prepare a `description` (about 20-30 words) for each input, detailing its role in the feature. Don't write about saving time etc. only useful information.

`app`:
`feature` (after `displayName` add or replace `description` and then `descriptionLong`):
`inputs list` (each `Property` should have added or replaced `description` property after `displayName`):
